[Efficient and Scalable Batch Bayesian Optimization Using K-Means](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01159.pdf)

> We present K-Means Batch Bayesian Optimization (KMBBO),a novel batch sampling algorithm for Bayesian Optimization(BO). KMBBO uses unsupervised learning to efficiently es-timate peaks of the model acquisition function. We show inempirical experiments that our method outperforms the cur-rent state-of-the-art batch allocation algorithms on a variety oftest problems including tuning of algorithm hyper-parametersand a challenging drug discovery problem.  In order to ac-commodate the real-world problem of high dimensional data,we propose a modification to KMBBO by combining it withcompressed sensing to project the optimization into a lowerdimensional subspace. We demonstrate empirically that this 2-step method outperforms algorithms where no dimensionalityreduction has taken place.
